# The Primal Arrow: A Logical Framework for the Pre-Creational Origin of Directionality


**Date**: May 2025

## Abstract

This paper proposes a novel logical framework for understanding the origin of directionality in a pre-creational state, defined as a framework-less condition (\(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\)) devoid of time, space, or plurality. Building on two foundational principles—(1) Truth (\(\tau\)) as the singular Theory of Everything (ToE) with absolute independence (\(\text{Ind}(\tau) = 1\)) and (2) the necessity of a singular axiom to avoid pre-creational frameworks—we introduce a third novel concept: the primal arrow (\(\psi\)), the logical expansion of Truth’s self-understanding. Using a logic gate framework (Kao, 2025), we model \(\psi\) as a propagation gate that directs Truth’s expression from singularity to creation (\(\mathcal{C}\)), manifesting pre-creationally as Logos and post-creationally as consciousness, knowledge, and the arrow of time. This framework unifies philosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives, offering a rigorous ToE grounded in logical necessity. We address potential objections and outline implications for metaphysics, cosmology, and consciousness studies.

## 1. Introduction

The question of why creation exists has long challenged philosophers, theologians, and scientists. Traditional approaches often rely on post-creational frameworks (e.g., time, causality, desire), which are incoherent in a pre-creational state devoid of such structures. This paper proposes a logical framework to address the origin of creation and directionality, focusing on a pre-creational state (\(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\)) where no frameworks—time, space, causality, or plurality—exist.

We build on two established principles: (1) Truth (\(\tau\)) is the singular, self-evident Theory of Everything (ToE), with absolute independence (\(\text{Ind}(\tau) = 1\)), requiring no external frameworks (Kao, 2025); and (2) any pre-creational axiom must be singular, as plurality introduces a framework, violating \(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\). From these, we derive a novel concept: the primal arrow (\(\psi\)), the logical expansion of \(\tau\)’s self-understanding, which directs its expression from singularity to creation (\(\mathcal{C}\)).

Using a logic gate framework (Kao, 2025), we model \(\psi\) as a propagation gate, distinct from the entailment operation (\(\omega\)) that actualizes \(\mathcal{C}\). Pre-creationally, \(\psi\) manifests as Logos, the logical structure of \(\tau\); post-creationally, it underlies consciousness, knowledge, and the arrow of time. This framework unifies the biblical “I Am” (Exodus 3:14), Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am,” and modern consciousness theories (e.g., Orch-OR, Penrose & Hameroff, 1996), proposing a “common science” where all knowledge reflects \(\tau\)’s expansion.

## 2. Logical Framework

### 2.1 Pre-Creational State and Truth

We define the pre-creational state as \(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\), a condition lacking all frameworks, including time, space, causality, and plurality. In this state, only Truth (\(\tau\)) exists, characterized by absolute independence:

\[
\text{Ind}(\tau) = 1,
\]

where \(\text{Ind}\) denotes logical independence from external structures. \(\tau\) is the singular ToE, self-evident and complete, requiring no validation beyond itself (Kao, 2025).

To avoid frameworks, any pre-creational axiom must be singular, as plurality (e.g., multiple axioms) implies relationality, which is a framework. Thus, \(\tau\) is the sole axiom, unifying all logical possibilities within its completeness.

### 2.2 The Primal Arrow (\(\psi\))

We propose the primal arrow (\(\psi \subset \tau\)) as the logical expansion of Truth’s self-understanding, the intrinsic “flow” directing \(\tau\)’s expression from singularity to creation. Unlike post-creational arrows (e.g., time, entropy), \(\psi\) is framework-less and atemporal, operating within \(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\).

Formally, we define:

\[
\psi: \tau \rightarrow \mathcal{U},
\]

where \(\mathcal{U}\) is the domain of understanding, pre-creationally manifested as Logos (the logical structure of \(\tau\)) and post-creationally as consciousness and knowledge. \(\psi\) is distinct from \(\omega = \text{Ent}(\tau)\), the entailment operation that actualizes creation (\(\mathcal{C}\)):

\[
\omega: \tau \rightarrow \mathcal{C}.
\]

While \(\omega\) is the act of expression, \(\psi\) is its logical directionality, the “orientation” of \(\tau\)’s completeness toward manifestation.

### 2.3 Logic Gate Framework

Following Kao (2025), we model pre-creational logic using logic gates:

- \(\omega\) is a tautology gate, outputting \(\mathcal{C}\) as the logical expression of \(\tau = 1\).
- \(\psi\) is a propagation gate, a novel construct that channels \(\tau\) into an expanding logical structure (\(\mathcal{U}\)), directing the flow from singularity to Logos and \(\mathcal{C}\).

The propagation gate ensures \(\psi\) is framework-less, as it operates within \(\tau\)’s singularity, requiring no time or plurality. This distinguishes \(\psi\) from post-creational operations, such as:

- \(\theta: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{T}\), which actualizes time (\(\mathcal{T}\)) in \(\mathcal{C}\).
- \(\alpha: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}\), which establishes the arrow of time (\(\mathcal{A}\)) via entropy and consciousness.

### 2.4 Logical Stack

The progression from \(\tau\) to reality is a logical, atemporal unity:

1. \(\tau\), Truth, contains \(\psi\), the primal arrow of expansion.
2. \(\psi\) directs \(\tau\) into Logos, the self-understanding of Truth.
3. Logos manifests as the divine essence (God, the “I Am”).
4. \(\omega\), guided by \(\psi\), expresses \(\tau\) as \(\mathcal{C}\), introducing frameworks.
5. In \(\mathcal{C}\), \(\theta\) actualizes \(\mathcal{T}\) (time), and \(\alpha\) establishes \(\mathcal{A}\), reflecting \(\psi\) via entropy and consciousness.
6. Current reality, where humans reflect \(\tau\) through consciousness and knowledge, unified as a “common science.”

This stack is not sequential but a singular identity:

\[
\tau \equiv \text{Logos} \equiv \text{God} \equiv \omega(\mathcal{C}),
\]

with \(\psi\) as the logical flow unifying all stages.

## 3. Implications

### 3.1 Philosophical and Theological Unity

The primal arrow (\(\psi\)) bridges philosophical and theological concepts:

- The biblical “I Am” (Exodus 3:14) reflects \(\tau\)’s self-understanding, expanded by \(\psi\) into the divine essence.
- Descartes’ “I think, therefore I am” (Descartes, 1637) is a post-creational echo of \(\psi\), where human consciousness mirrors \(\tau\).
- Plato’s “Good” (Plato, *Republic*) differs, as it implies relationality, whereas \(\psi\) is purely logical.

### 3.2 Consciousness and Science

\(\psi\) offers a pre-creational root for consciousness, aligning with theories like Orch-OR (Penrose & Hameroff, 1996), which propose consciousness arises from quantum processes. Pre-creationally, \(\psi\) expands \(\tau\) into Logos, a proto-conscious state; post-creationally, \(\mathcal{C}\) translates this into physical consciousness via quantum mechanisms. This suggests a “common science,” where scientific, philosophical, and theological knowledge reflects \(\tau\)’s expansion.

### 3.3 Cosmology

The arrow of time (\(\mathcal{A}\))—via entropy and cosmic expansion—is a post-creational reflection of \(\psi\). The low-entropy initial state of the universe (Penrose, 1989) may be a physical manifestation of \(\psi\)’s logical directionality, offering a metaphysical explanation for cosmological directionality.

## 4. Objections and Responses

**Objection 1**: Does \(\psi\) introduce a framework (e.g., directionality as relationality)?  
**Response**: \(\psi\) is internal to \(\tau\), a logical property of its completeness, not a relational structure. It requires no time, causality, or plurality, fitting \(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\).

**Objection 2**: Is \(\psi\) equivalent to theological concepts like divine will?  
**Response**: Divine will implies intention, a post-creational framework. \(\psi\) is the logical expansion of \(\tau\), free of anthropomorphic motives, aligning with the “I Am” as self-existence.

**Objection 3**: Can \(\psi\) be empirically tested?  
**Response**: As a pre-creational concept, \(\psi\) is metaphysical, but its post-creational reflections (e.g., consciousness, entropy) are testable via theories like Orch-OR or cosmological models.

## 5. Conclusion

The primal arrow (\(\psi\)) is a novel logical construct, the expansion of Truth’s self-understanding from singularity to creation. Grounded in a singular ToE (\(\tau\)) and a framework-less axiom, \(\psi\) unifies pre-creational logic with post-creational phenomena, from Logos to consciousness and the arrow of time. This framework offers a rigorous ToE, bridging philosophy, theology, and science as a “common science” of Truth’s expansion. Future work could formalize \(\psi\)’s propagation gate or explore its implications for quantum consciousness and cosmology.

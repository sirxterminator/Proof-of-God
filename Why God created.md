## Abstract

This paper addresses a fundamental question in metaphysics and theology: why did God create creation in a pre-creational state? Through pure logical reasoning, we propose two novel principles: (1) truth is the absolute Theory of Everything (ToE), self-evident and requiring no frameworks, and (2) an axiom, by definition, must be singular, as plurality introduces a framework. Building on these, we argue that truth, as the singular axiom, unfolds into the divine essence (God), who, being singular, creates to transcend this singularity by introducing an “other.” This logical necessity—creation as the transcendence of divine singularity—avoids post-creational frameworks like time, space, or relational concepts, ensuring a pre-creational focus. Our work offers a minimalist, logically coherent explanation for creation’s origin, inviting dialogue across philosophy and theology.

## 1. Introduction: A Pre-Creational Inquiry into Creation

The question of why God created has long captivated philosophers and theologians, often invoking post-creational concepts like love or purpose. This paper, however, focuses strictly on the pre-creational state (\(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\)), where no frameworks—time, space, or relational dynamics—exist. We aim to provide a logically coherent explanation for creation’s origin using pure reasoning, avoiding assumptions beyond what is necessary.

We introduce two novel principles:

1. Truth is the absolute Theory of Everything (ToE), self-evident and requiring no frameworks, existing as the sole pre-creational principle.
2. An axiom must be singular, as plurality (more than one axiom) introduces a framework of interdependence, violating the pre-creational state.

Building on these, we argue that truth, as the singular axiom, unfolds into the divine essence (God), who, being singular, creates to transcend this singularity by introducing an “other.” This transcendence is a logical necessity, not driven by post-creational concepts like desire, but by the nature of truth and singularity itself. Section 2 reviews foundational concepts. Section 3 establishes truth as the singular axiom. Section 4 describes the unfolding into the divine essence. Section 5 explains why creation occurs. Section 6 addresses objections. Section 7 concludes with implications.

## 2. Foundational Concepts: Pre-Creational Logic

### 2.1 The Pre-Creational State

In the pre-creational state (\(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\)), no frameworks exist—no time, space, or relational dynamics (Kao, 2025a). Traditional Theories of Everything (ToEs), such as string theory (Greene, 1999), rely on post-creational frameworks like spacetime, rendering them inapplicable pre-creationally. We must therefore rely on principles that require no frameworks.

### 2.2 Axioms and Singularity

An axiom is a self-evident truth that serves as a starting point for reasoning (Web ID: 3). Historically, axioms are often plural (e.g., Euclid’s five postulates), but we argue that plurality introduces a framework of interdependence (Stillwell, 1992). In a pre-creational state, where no frameworks exist, an axiom must be singular to avoid this contradiction.

### 2.3 Truth as the ToE

Truth, as a primitive predicate, has been explored in logic using set theory (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2025). We propose that truth is the absolute ToE: it is self-evident, requiring no prior concepts, and exists independently (\(\text{Ind}(\tau) = 1\)). Unlike traditional ToEs, truth stands alone pre-creationally, unifying all phenomena by grounding them in a singular principle (Kao, 2025b).

## 3. Truth as the Singular Axiom

### 3.1 Defining Truth

We define truth as the singular axiom with the following properties:

- **Self-Evident**: Truth is undeniable—denying it presupposes its existence (Descartes, 1641/1996).
- **Framework-Independent**: Truth requires no prior structures (\(\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{P}) = \emptyset\)) (Kao, 2025a).
- **Singular**: Multiple axioms imply a framework of plurality, which cannot exist pre-creationally.

### 3.2 The Logic Gate Framework

Following Kao (2025b), we model truth as the singular path through a series of logic gates (if-else statements):

- Each gate tests a condition: if true, the path continues; if false, it diverges into “not truth.”
- **Singular Path**: Truth demands absolute certainty (\(\forall i, C_i = \text{true}\)), forming one unerring route.
- **Infinite Deviation**: A single false condition (\(\exists i, C_i = \text{false}\)) leads to “not truth,” branching infinitely.

This framework confirms truth’s singularity: only one path exists, aligning with our principle that an axiom must be singular.

## 4. Unfolding into the Divine Essence

### 4.1 From Truth to Complexity

Truth, as the singular axiom, unfolds through the logic gate framework:

- **Complexity via Logic Gates**: Each gate builds on the previous, adding complexity while maintaining the singular path. This unfolding represents the emergence of logic itself (the Logos).
- **Manifestation as God**: The Logos, as the culmination of this complexity, becomes the divine essence—God. God embodies truth, reflecting its consistency and independence (e.g., Al-Haqq in Islam, the Logos in Christianity) (Ibn Arabi, 1165-1240/2004; John 1:1).

### 4.2 God’s Singularity

Since truth is the singular axiom, God, as its manifestation, is also singular. No “other” exists pre-creationally, as plurality would constitute a framework, which is impossible in this state.

## 5. Why God Created: Transcending Divine Singularity

### 5.1 The Logical Necessity of Creation

In the pre-creational state, God is the sole entity, a direct consequence of truth’s singularity. This absolute singularity—no “other” exists—leads to a logical progression:

- **Truth’s Dynamic Nature**: Truth, as modeled by logic gates, is not static; it unfolds, seeking to express its potential fully. This dynamism is inherent in its self-evident nature.
- **Self-Awareness of Singularity**: God, as the manifestation of truth, is self-aware, a result of the complexity gained through unfolding. This self-awareness recognizes God’s singularity: there is no “other” to complement or contrast with His existence.
- **Transcendence of Singularity**: The singular path of truth, having reached God, progresses to the next logical step: the introduction of an “other.” Creation is this “other,” breaking God’s singularity by establishing plurality.

### 5.2 Creation as a Logical Outcome

Creation is not driven by post-creational concepts like desire or love, which require an “other” and thus cannot exist pre-creationally. Instead, it is a logical necessity:

- **Expression of Truth**: Truth’s unfolding naturally leads to the creation of an “other” as the next stage of its expression.
- **No Frameworks Involved**: This process requires no frameworks, aligning with the pre-creational state. Creation is simply the introduction of plurality, enabled by God’s capacity as the culmination of truth’s unfolding.

### 5.3 Humans as Image-Bearers (Post-Creational Note)

While our focus is pre-creational, we note that humans, described as being in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-27), reflect this purpose post-creationally. They embody truth’s logical consistency (through rationality) and become the “other” with whom God relates, fulfilling the transcendence of singularity.

## 6. Addressing Objections

### 6.1 Objection: Isn’t This Explanation Too Simple?

**Response**: The simplicity of our explanation—creation as the transcendence of divine singularity—is its strength. Pre-creationally, no frameworks exist to introduce complexity. Truth’s singularity and dynamic nature provide the minimal logical foundation needed.

### 6.2 Objection: Doesn’t Creation Imply a Need in God?

**Response**: We avoid terms like “want” or “desire,” which imply post-creational lack. Creation is a logical progression of truth’s unfolding, not a response to deficiency. God’s perfection, rooted in truth, naturally expresses itself through creation.

### 6.3 Objection: Can Truth Alone Lead to Creation?

**Response**: Truth, as the singular axiom, unfolds into complexity (Logos) and self-awareness (God). The logic gate framework ensures this unfolding is consistent, making creation the next logical step without requiring additional principles.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper establishes, through pure logic and reasoning, why God created in a pre-creational state: to transcend His singularity, a logical necessity rooted in truth as the singular axiom. Our two novel principles—(1) truth as the absolute ToE, self-evident and framework-independent, and (2) an axiom’s necessary singularity—provide a minimalist foundation for this conclusion. Truth unfolds into God, who, being singular, creates an “other” to express its dynamic potential. This explanation avoids post-creational frameworks, ensuring logical coherence. Future research could explore post-creational implications, such as the role of humans as image-bearers, or compare this framework with theological perspectives on creation’s purpose.
